# Stock Photo Analysis Tool

## Overview

This is a modern web application that analyzes images and videos for stock photography purposes using AI. The application allows users to upload images or videos and receive detailed analysis including descriptions, keywords, categorization, and market viability assessments. For videos, the system automatically extracts multiple frames and allows users to select the best frame for analysis. Built with a React frontend and Express backend, it leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o for intelligent image analysis.

- **Video Frame Extraction**: Automatic extraction of 10 frames from uploaded videos with visual frame selection grid
- **Best Frame Selection**: Interactive frame selector allowing users to choose the optimal frame for analysis
- **Metadata Display**: Resolution, megapixels, aspect ratio, and quality indicators for both images and video frames
- **Analysis Controls**: Keyword count slider (5-50), character limit slider (50-500), and customer review input
- **Results Display**: Comprehensive analysis presentation with character counters
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Usage metrics and performance indicators

## Data Flow

### Image Analysis Flow
1. **File Upload**: User selects, drags, or pastes image/video file to upload interface
2. **File Type Detection**: System determines if uploaded file is image or video
3. **Video Processing** (if video): Extract 10 frames using HTML5 video canvas API, display frame selection grid
4. **Frame Selection** (if video): User selects best frame from extracted frames grid
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Frontend extracts dimensions, calculates megapixels and quality metrics from selected frame/image
6. **File Processing**: Convert selected frame or image to base64 for API transmission
7. **API Request**: Analysis request sent to backend with image data, parameters, and optional customer review
8. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4o processes image with resolution context and customer feedback for tailored analysis
9. **Data Storage**: Analysis results with full metadata stored in PostgreSQL database
10. **Response Delivery**: Results with character counts and quality indicators returned to frontend
11. **Statistics Update**: Analysis metrics updated for dashboard display
